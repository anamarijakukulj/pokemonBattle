# pokemonBattle

TASK:

· Create an application for Pokémon battle. · The data is fetched from the PokeApi.

· Click on the button “Start Poke Battle” will fetch 2 random Pokemons, and based on their attributes of your own choice (weight, height, attack, HP, etc.), one of the Pokemons will win the battle.

· Every Pokemon needs to be displayed with image and name.

· When battle is finished, winner Pokemon must be stored in the browser's local storage, and the button “Start Poke Battle” will now have a new label “Start New Battle”.

· With click on the button “Start New Battle”, a new random Pokemon will be fetched, and have a battle with the currently saved winner Pokemon. If newly fetched Pokemon wins, he will be replaced as the new winner Pokemon in storage.

· If the winner Pokemon exists, the button “End Game” must be displayed.

· With click on the button “End Game”, local storage will be restored, winner will be erased, and the button “Start Poke Battle” will be visible again.
